# Messaging Service

## Overview
An example instant messaging service where users can send messages to each other.

## Design
- **User**: simple user account with identifier and name.
- **Message**: represents text content and sender/receiver.
- **MessagingService**: stores messages and provides send/receive methods.
- **Main**: sample interaction sending and reading messages.

## Principles & Patterns
- *Single Responsibility* for core classes.
- Service pattern to encapsulate business logic of messaging.

## Features
- Send messages from one user to another.
- Retrieve received messages for a user.

## Possible Improvements
- Add persistence and indexing for searching messages.
- Support group chats and message status (seen, delivered).
- Implement authentication and real-time delivery via websockets.

## LLD Notes
The service stores messages in an in-memory list. For production use this would integrate with a database and possibly message queues for real-time delivery.
