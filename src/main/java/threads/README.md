# Thread Utilities

This package contains small demonstrations of core Java concurrency constructs.

- **RunnableExample** – shows creating threads with `Runnable`.
- **CallableExample** – demonstrates returning a value from a background task using `Callable` and `FutureTask`.
- **ExecutorServiceDemo** – illustrates several variations of `ExecutorService` including fixed, cached and single-thread pools, as well as a scheduled executor service.
- **ThreadExample** – extends the `Thread` class directly.
- Additional classes show synchronization primitives such as locks and semaphores.

These examples can be run individually using `java` or your IDE.
