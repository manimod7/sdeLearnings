Leetcode 207: Course Schedule I

üß† Problem:
You are given `numCourses` courses labeled from 0 to numCourses-1 and a list of prerequisites.
Each prerequisite is a pair [a, b], meaning you must take course `b` before course `a`.

Return true if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise return false.

‚û°Ô∏è Example:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true (Take 0 first, then 1)

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false (Cycle exists)

‚úÖ Goal:
Detect if a **cycle** exists in the course dependency graph.

--------------------------------------------------
üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach: DFS-Based Cycle Detection

- Treat courses as nodes in a directed graph.
- An edge from course `b` to `a` means: to take `a`, you need `b` first.
- If there's a cycle in the graph, you cannot finish all courses.

We use:
- DFS to traverse the graph.
- A `visited` array to mark the status of each node:
    0 = not visited
    1 = visiting (in recursion stack)
    2 = visited (safe / no cycle from this node)

If during DFS we revisit a node marked as "visiting", it means we found a cycle.

--------------------------------------------------
‚è± Time Complexity: O(N + E)
- N = number of courses (nodes)
- E = number of prerequisites (edges)

üíæ Space Complexity: O(N + E)
- Graph storage + visited array + recursion stack
